So I just finished watching Flight Risk, and man, what a rollercoaster. Like, I knew going in it would be intense, but seriously, it was like bam-bam-bam from one scene to the next. You could literally feel the tension building all the way through. Gotta say though, the dorky copilot made it all a bit too real – kind of wish those type of guys stayed fictional, lol.

And can we talk about the main guy for a sec? He’s got that tortured hero vibe down but also makes you wanna invite him for beers and tell him it’s gonna be okay. Some of those plot twists, though, I mean... just when you think you’ve got things figured out, they switch it up again. It’s like the screenwriters can’t decide if they’re writing an action movie or a full-blown thriller.

> Anyway, at some point I thought, “Do I really need this stress?” But then, there I was, down the rabbit hole, downloading the movie after already needing to watch it like twice. Can't trust myself when it comes to impulse downloads, apparently. 🙄

Shoutout to the background music too – it’s one of those situations where it pumps so hard you’re practically feeling the bass in your chest even though you're just in your living room. Makes you lowkey paranoid every time a door closes, hahaha. Imagine if doing groceries felt that dramatic.

But yeah, the end—or should I say the many possible endings that they hint at? Blew my mind. Didn’t see that one coming. Good time killer, but maybe next time, remind me to watch something less likely to spike my blood pressure.

var unnecessaryCoding = Why did I even type this?;

So what’s good with you? We should catch a chill flick next time, something with puppies or cupcakes or whatever.
